# TruePath

TruePath generates relative XPath on right click on web page. 

When a user right click on any web element on web page, it fetches out all the relative XPath associated with that web element.

It further group out the XPath as Unique XPath or Non Unique XPath. Non Unique XPath means multiple nodes are present for this XPath. Use index to select the required XPath. 

Support for iframes is not available now. 

Please wait till the web page to load to search for XPath. 

This is beta a release. 

It supports Firefox 52+ versions.
